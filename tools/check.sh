# takes seconds, and the longer tiers run in the background while the work goes on.
#
#   tools/check.sh          the gate: what must pass before a commit lands on main. Formatting,
#                           lints, and every test but the long ones and the measurements, on the
#                           CPU and the GPU (release builds): unit, conformance, diagnostics
#                           goldens, run and GPU tests, grammar and fuzz samples; the tools'
#                           tests; the browser runtime's checks; the WGSL size budgets. Its tests
#                           have a budget (below); it fails if they take longer.
#   tools/check.sh --long   also the long checks, at their smaller sizes: the tests whose
#                           `#[ignore]` reason starts `long:` (headless Chrome against the native
#                           host, the clearing's camera path, soak runs, images against spike
#                           01's), sharing the GPU; the grammar's 10^6 programs and 200,000 GBNF
#                           samples; the WGSL size budgets of the packages that bake a
#                           history (the floor); 20,000 fuzz cases from a new seed; and two of the
#                           measurements, in turn, reported but not gated. About ten minutes,
#                           plus the two: before a branch is merged, in the background.
#   tools/check.sh --full   also everything at full size, and the measurements: the long checks
#                           with `WRELA_FULL`, every test at full size, the tests whose reason
#                           starts `measure:` (time budgets and comparisons with spike 01) one at
#                           a time with the GPU alone, the CLI's speed budgets, and 10^6 fuzz
#                           cases. Hours: on an idle machine, when a milestone's numbers are
