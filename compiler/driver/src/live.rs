//! Hot reload (#28 §9, language.md §23): `wrela run <package>` builds the program lifted, serves
//! it to Chrome on 127.0.0.1, and watches its files and its dependencies'. A change that touches
//! only lifted literals goes to the running program as their new values (no build); any other
//! change builds the program again, and the page swaps the new build in where the old one was,
//! without reloading (runtime/browser's live.ts). The native host's [`Watcher`] user does the
//! same with `wrela_host::Host::set_literal` and `Host::reload`.
