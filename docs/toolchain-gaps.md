# Toolchain gaps

*Capabilities this repository needed from the toolchain ([rywible/wrela-compiler](https://github.com/rywible/wrela-compiler)) and found missing or broken. AGENTS.md's rule holds: a gap is fixed in the toolchain, released, and the pin moved; never worked around here in another language. Started 2026-10-21 at Ryan's request.*

Each entry says what was needed, what happens instead, how it was found, the evidence, what this repository does meanwhile, and its status. Add an entry when a gap is found; when the fix ships, say in which release and keep the entry.

### `wrela trace` and `wrela bisect` don't run a program's ticker

- **Needed:** an agent watching a ticked game's state frame by frame (`wrela trace <package> --watch <export> --input script.json`), and finding the first frame a condition holds (`wrela bisect`).
- **What happens:** the ticker never ticks. Exports that read the sim's snapshots stay at the first world's values for every frame.
- **Found:** 2026-10-21, building the capybara movement lab (`games/capybara`). With the run script, `wrela trace games/capybara --watch capybara,clock` printed tick count 0 for 120 frames, with or without `--no-gpu` and `--workers 2`. The same build, under `wrela-host --frames N --input`, and as a frame test (`@test(frames: 180, gpu: true, input: ...)`), ticks two ticks a frame in lockstep.
- **Cause, from the source:** `compiler/cli/src/trace.rs` steps each frame with the host's `frame()`; the native host's lockstep path (`lockstep_frame` in `runtime/native/src/program.rs`) is what runs the ticks due before a frame.
- **Meanwhile:** traces of the capybara's movement come from tests that step the sim directly; stills come from `wrela-host`.
- **Status:** open. Fix: trace and bisect run frames on the lockstep schedule when the program starts a ticker, as `wrela-host` and frame tests do, with a test in the toolchain's `trace` suite.

### A ticked program doesn't start in the Claude desktop app's browser pane

- **Needed:** an agent playing a ticked game in the browser pane beside the session (and anyone in an embedded Chrome).
- **What happens:** the page stops with "wrela stopped: the ticker's thread failed: it couldn't start". The page is cross-origin isolated, with `SharedArrayBuffer` and WebGPU (the pane's Chrome is 152).
- **Found:** 2026-10-21, with `games/capybara` and `examples/climber-lab`, under `wrela run` and as a static build (`wrela tool serve`). Both fail alike.
- **Likely cause, not confirmed:** the runtime starts the ticker as a module worker from inside the render worker (`new Worker(self.location.href, { type: "module" })` in `worker.js`), and the pane's error event carries no message. Nested module workers may be unavailable there.
- **Meanwhile:** play in Chrome itself. In-Chrome play of the capybara lab is still to be checked: a headless Chrome run in test mode ended before writing results, so it says nothing either way.
- **Status:** open; the cause needs confirming before a fix. If nested workers are the cause, a fix is for the page to start the ticker's worker and hand its port to the render worker.
