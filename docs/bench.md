# Bench

Performance claims about wrela's programs are recorded here: what was measured, on what, with
which build. The plan these come from is [plan-world-class.md](plan-world-class.md).

## Browsers

Checked 2026-10-25 on an Apple M4 MacBook Air (macOS 26), with toolchain release-0.6.1 (the
branch, before its release) and the workspace at B10 (`dea4ccfc`). Each program was opened from
`wrela run <package>` on 127.0.0.1.

- **Starts:** whether the program reached its first screen and drew it.
- **Features:** the adapter's WebGPU features as the page reads them
  (`navigator.gpu.requestAdapter()`); `std::gpu::features()` reports the ones it names (`f16`,
  `subgroups`, `bc`, `etc2`, `astc`, the 32-bit float filtering).
- **Frame interval:** the time between 600 consecutive `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks, read by a
  script in the page while the program ran. The plan named the games' "F7 debug readout" for
  this, but F7 takes stills and no game shows a 95th percentile; the capybara's F3 readout shows
  a mean.

### The Claude desktop app's browser pane (Chrome 152)

The page: `Claude/3.6556.2 Chrome/152.0.7977.167`, device pixel ratio 2, its canvas 2048 × 1536.
Adapter: Apple, `metal-3`.

| Program | Starts | Frame interval (median / p95 / max, ms) | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `games/capybara` | Yes. A mouse press on `Start` starts the game; a held arrow key moves the capybara | 16.67 / 18.22 / 18.67, running right | None |
| `examples/clearing` | Yes | 16.67 / 18.01 / 33.33 | None |
| `games/last-green` | Yes | Not measured: the pane was hidden by then, and a hidden page's frames are throttled | None |

Features: `bgra8unorm-storage`, `clip-distances`, `core-features-and-limits`,
`depth-clip-control`, `depth32float-stencil8`, `dual-source-blending`, `float32-blendable`,
`float32-filterable`, `indirect-first-instance`, `primitive-index`, `rg11b10ufloat-renderable`,
`shader-f16`, `subgroup-size-control`, `subgroups`, `texture-component-swizzle`,
`texture-compression-astc`, `texture-compression-astc-sliced-3d`, `texture-compression-bc`,
`texture-compression-bc-sliced-3d`, `texture-compression-etc2`, `texture-formats-tier1`,
`texture-formats-tier2`, `timestamp-query`. So `features()` reports all of `f16`,
`subgroups`, `bc`, `etc2` and `astc`.

The fix in toolchain 0.5.1 (ticked programs start in the pane) holds on 0.6.x: no regression, so
no gaps entry.

The pane's key tool presses and releases a key within one frame, which the capybara reads as
no hold, so it doesn't move; a key held through the page (a `keydown`, then a `keyup` 1.5 s later)
moves it. That's the agent's tool, not the toolchain's.

### Safari 26.6.2

Not checked. The agent's screen access to Safari was declined, and Safari's own automation
(`safaridriver`, or JavaScript from Apple Events) is a setting only a person can turn on. To
check by hand: open each address `wrela run` prints, press `Start` on the capybara, and record
the same three columns.

### Firefox

Not checked: Firefox isn't installed on this machine, and installing it was left to its owner.
