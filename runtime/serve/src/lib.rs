//! The server host (language.md §19): a server build's rooms, over WebTransport. A session at
//! `/room/<name>?pair=<id>` is a connection of room `<name>`, from a client build whose pair id
//! is `<id>` (16 hex digits): one of another pair is refused before it reaches a room. It opens
//! one bidirectional stream, on which each message is a frame: its length (a varint, at most
//! [`MAX_FRAME`] bytes, and [`MAX_UP`] from a client), then its bytes. Each room runs on a
//! thread of its own
//! ([`wrela_host::rooms::RoomHost`]), which keeps it durably in the data directory and releases
//! what it sends only once its records are kept; a room with no connections for
//! [`Bounds::idle`] stops, and starts again from its journal when one comes.
//!
//! What it holds is bounded ([`Bounds`]): the sessions open or opening, the rooms running, and
//! the bytes queued, each message counted with [`OVERHEAD`] more. Each connection may hold
//! [`RESERVED`] bytes each way whatever the others hold; past that, its messages draw on what
//! every queue shares ([`Bounds::queued`]), so a few slow connections can't crowd out the rest.
//! A connection that sends faster than its room takes ([`CONN_IN`] waiting), or takes what its
//! room sends slower than the room sends it ([`CONN_OUT`] waiting, or a write that takes
//! [`WRITE`]), is closed, and its peer comes back. At most, then, the queues hold
//! `2 × sessions × RESERVED + queued` bytes.
