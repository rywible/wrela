//! # The wrela runtime ABI
//!
//! This crate is the one definition of how a compiled wrela program talks to a host (the browser
//! runtime in `runtime/browser`, or the native host in `runtime/native`). It's an executable
//! spec: the format's version, opcodes and layouts are defined here, documented here, and
//! pinned by golden byte tests. The browser runtime's constants are generated from it
//! ([`typescript`]), and so are std's ([`wrela`]); a test fails if a checked-in copy drifts.
//!
//! ## What a build ships (D-099)
//!
//! - `game.wasm`: the program's CPU code.
//! - One WGSL module per pipeline.
//! - `manifest.json`: a [`Manifest`]. It names the WASM and lists every pipeline.
//! - The standard runtime, pinned to the version the program was built with (D-100).
//!
//! ## The program ABI
//!
//! The WASM module
//! - exports its linear memory as `memory`;
//! - exports `frame(time: f32, width: u32, height: u32)`, which the host calls once per frame
//!   with the seconds since the program started and the canvas size in pixels;
//! - may export `init()`, which the host calls once, after instantiating the module and before
//!   anything else: a program with state makes it there (language.md §15);
//! - imports `wrela.submit(ptr: i32, len: i32)`, which hands the host a batch of commands: `len`
//!   bytes at `ptr` in its memory (see [`stream`]); and may import
//!   `wrela.request_status(request: i32) -> i32` and `wrela.request_take(request: i32, ptr: i32)`,
//!   which answer the requests its batches make, `wrela.limit(index: i32) -> i32`, which
//!   gives one of the GPU's limits ([`Limits`]), `wrela.audio(task: i32, context: i32)`,
//!   which starts the program's voice ([`IMPORT_AUDIO`]), `wrela.tick(task: i32, context: i32,
//!   hz: i32)`, which starts its ticker ([`IMPORT_TICK`]), and `wrela.input(ptr: i32, cap: i32)
//!   -> i32`, which gives it the pointer and keyboard events that have arrived ([`input`]);
//! - imports its memory, shared, as `wrela.memory` ([`memory`]);
//! - may export thread entries (`__worker`, `__audio`, `__tick`), which a host calls on the
//!   program's other threads ([`memory`]'s threads);
//! - may have a start function, which runs as each instance starts and may not call the host:
//!   the compiler's copies the program's constants into the memory, once however many instances
//!   share it ([`memory::DATA_READY`]).
//!
//! Nothing else is imported, so nothing host-dependent can reach the program's arithmetic
//! (D-015). Other exports are the program's own `pub fn`s, which tests may call.
//!
//! ## The state hash
//!
//! [`hash::StateHash`] is FNV-1a 64 over every byte of every batch the program submits, in
//! order. Two hosts running the same program at the same frame times must compute the same
//! hash (AC7).
