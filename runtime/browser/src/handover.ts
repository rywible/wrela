// One build hands its place to another in the same page (`std::reload::prepare`, `unprepare` and
// `hand_over`), as in the native host (runtime/native/src/handover.rs): a game made of several
// builds, such as a tower of floors, each started when the player reaches it.
//
// - Prepare: the build's files are fetched, its WASM compiled and the pipelines the device
//   doesn't hold yet built, while the program runs. They wait until a hand-over takes them or
//   the program lets the build go.
// - Hand over: after the frame that asked, the build is got ready (then, if it isn't), and the
//   render worker stops the running program and starts the build with what the old one kept
//   (worker.ts). A build that can't be got ready fails the request, and the old program goes on.
