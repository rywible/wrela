//! `std::tool::toolchain` (language.md §15.5): builds, tests, checks, formatting and the
//! reference docs of packages in a tool's roots, by the compiler's own code in this process.
//! The host has no compiler: whoever runs the tool host gives it one ([`Toolchain`], which
//! `wrela tool` makes from the compiler's driver). This module is the service's mechanism: it
//! reads requests as std writes them, finds their packages and outputs through the grants, runs
//! the compiler's work beside the tool, writes its files through the grants, and answers.
//!
//! **One capability context for every read.** A package and its output are root paths
//! (`NAME/rel`). The compiler is given the same roots the grants opened, as directory handles
//! ([`Job::roots`]), and reads every file through them: the package's sources and manifest, its
//! dependencies' (a dependency outside the roots is an error), the workspace's manifest and its
//! members', and what `embed` reads. Its constants' cache is a directory the host owns
//! ([`Job::cache`]), never one beside a read-only package. Its outputs are written through the
//! grants, into a write root.
//!
//! **Every request can be stopped.** The compiler's work runs on a thread of its own; the worker
//! that waits for it looks for the request's deadline (from when the host took it) and the
//! tool's end every few milliseconds. Then it cancels the work, which the compiler sees between
//! its phases, and a program the work runs (`wasm-opt`) has its process group killed at once
//! ([`Job::run`]). If the work hasn't stopped within the grace after that, the run is the
//! host's failure (status 71), as an HTTP client that won't return is. Files a failed build
//! wrote are removed.
