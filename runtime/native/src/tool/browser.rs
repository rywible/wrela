//! `std::tool::browser` (language.md §15.5): Chrome stable, headless, on the hardware GPU, with a
//! throwaway profile in the host's own directory for the run, driven over the DevTools protocol
//! on Chrome's pipe (`wrela_chrome`). `open` starts a browser of its own for a page; `run`
//! carries out a script's typed steps; the observations read what the page shows; `capture`
//! gives its screen as a PNG; `close` ends it. Starting one needs the `--browser` grant.
//!
//! **A browser reaches only what the tool is granted.** Every connection it makes, of its
//! pages, their workers and Chrome itself, goes through a proxy of the host's
//! (`wrela_chrome::proxy`), with no implicit bypass, and QUIC and WebTransport off. A plain HTTP
//! request goes on only to an origin of one of the tool's running servers (`std::tool::serve`,
//! `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`); a tunnel (HTTPS, a WebSocket) only to a host and port that
//! `--net` grants (443 for a grant with none). Anything else is refused before a connection is
//! made, and the page's console says so. A tool test's fake sites aren't the browser's.
//!
//! **A page's result is what its server kept, for this browser.** `results` and a wait for it
//! read the `results/DONE` that the page's server (the tool's own, on the port of the URL it
//! opened) has written from a request of this browser's: the proxy names each request with the
//! browser's session, and the server keeps a result for each session. A request in flight, one
//! the server refused or hasn't finished, and another browser's page's, aren't this one's.
//!
//! **A browser is a resource of its request.** Its process group is recorded for the
//! supervisor (`run::let_go`) before Chrome runs; it's registered under the `open` request as
//! soon as Chrome answers, before its page opens and before the answer that names it reaches
//! the tool. If the request fails, or the tool ends first, the host closes it: the group killed,
//! the profile removed. A start in progress when the tool ends is given up. Chrome holds the
//! host's end of its pipe, so if the host is killed it shuts down too, and the run's directory
//! is swept at the next run.
//!
//! **Closing is never held up.** Each browser has a cancel flag, which `close` sets as the host
//! takes the request (before any worker does: every worker may be busy, with this browser's
//! wait among them), or the tool's end sets, then closes the browser's pipe: every request using it
//! (a wait, even of 600 s, reads the flag as it waits) fails at once, and lets the page go; then
//! `close` takes the page within the grace, or the run is the host's failure.
//!
//! **Deadlines count from the request.** Each request has one (60 s, or its `timeout`, at most
//! 600 s), from when the host took it; a script's waits and clicks are bounded by it too. A
//! capture reserves its blob's most bytes (a PNG of the viewport, stored) in the budget before
//! it asks Chrome for the screen. No observation is cut short: one whose answer would be more
//! than 512 KiB fails, saying so.
