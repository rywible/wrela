//! `std::tool::run` (language.md §15.5): a program the grants name (`--allow-run`), run as a
//! process of its own, with its arguments, its standard input, and what it writes to its
//! standard output and error given back. No shell runs: the program is the executable found
//! when the grants were opened.
//!
//! **What it gets.** An empty environment, then a fixed baseline: `PATH` as it was when the
//! grants were opened, `HOME` a directory the host owns for this run, `LANG=C.UTF-8`; then the
//! request's variables, and the granted secrets it names, by name. It works in a write root the
//! request names. A program runs with the user's authority, natively: the working directory is
//! where it starts, not a confinement.
//!
//! **Its process group is the host's.** The program leads a process group of its own, and the
//! host kills that group (`SIGKILL`) when the program ends, so nothing it started outlives it;
//! past the request's deadline; past [`MOST_OUTPUT`] bytes of output; and when the tool ends.
//! The worker that runs it looks for the tool's end every few milliseconds, so the host's grace
//! is never spent waiting for a program. Its input and output are files in the host's own
//! directory for the run, so no pipe a program holds open can hold up the host; they're
//! removed however the request ends, and the output goes into the answer a chunk at a time,
//! charged to the blob budget as it's read. The deadline counts from when the host took the
//! request: one still queued at it isn't started. Each group is written to the supervisor's
//! file (`Options::groups`), if there is one, as the program starts.
//!
//! A `tool:` program is a tool package, which `wrela tool` runs on the tool host in its process,
//! as any program, with the request's working directory as its one write root (under the same
//! name), its arguments, the secrets the request names, what's left of the request's deadline
//! as its `--timeout`, and the supervisor's file of groups ([`GROUPS_ENV`]).
