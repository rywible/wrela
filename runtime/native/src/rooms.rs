//! A room kept durably (language.md §19): a [`Room`] of a server build, its journal on disk, and
//! the rules that make it survive a crash. The journal holds the records its program gave the
//! host (`platform::net`'s `keep` and `compact`); the host keeps a call's records, flushed to
//! disk, before it releases anything the call sent or closed, so what any peer saw committed is
//! in the journal. A room that starts reads its journal back first, as messages from connection
//! `JOURNAL` (0), before any live event, and then hears of its open connections again, each with
//! the tag the program gave it (`platform::net::tag`). A call is given what waits a call's worth
//! at a time ([`wrela_abi::input::within_call`]), and must read all of it.
//!
//! A call that fails keeps nothing and sends nothing, and the room starts again from its journal
//! and takes the call's events again one at a time, so one event can't fail the rest. Alone, an
//! event's failure says whose it is ([`Failure`]):
//! - the program's own trap (or a `serve` that returns with events unread): the event, if it's
//!   a message, is given back with `POISONED` set on its connection, so the program refuses it
//!   durably without running it. A trap on a poisoned message, or while reading the journal
//!   back, quarantines the room: it's never skipped past, what waits goes, and its connections
//!   close.
//! - the host's limits (the deadline, the memory cap, the stack, a call's commands): the event
//!   waits, with those after it, for the next wake, and after [`RETRIES`] failures in a row the
//!   room's connections are closed, so its peers come back later.
//!
//! One room host at a time in a process holds a room's journal; another of the same room (a
//! build swapped away and back, say) waits for it to close. The journal is made with its first
//! record.
//!
//! The journal: a header (`WRJ1`, the format's version, the server build's WASM hash, the room's
//! name), then records, each its length, its CRC-32C and its bytes. A journal of another build,
//! format or room isn't read: the room doesn't open. A record cut short or whose CRC is wrong
//! ends the journal there (a crash in the middle of a write), and it's truncated to the records
//! before it.
